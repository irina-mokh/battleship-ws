## Notes

* User is validated by name: only one user can have same certain name. Password is checked while 'reg' operation.

* User leaves during the game -> his opponent wins. User leaves and has a room -> room gets deleted.

*  One user can create only 1 room. Any other user can join it. User can't join it's own room. It's allowed for one user to join several rooms of different players.

* Game has a single play mode (game with bot). Bot is not really smart, but it's really random ðŸ˜Š 

* Winners table is displayed and sorted for users with at least 1 win. Win in bot-game is not counted as a real win for winners table.
